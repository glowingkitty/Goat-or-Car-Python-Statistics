# Goat-or-Car-Python-Statistics
A nice statistic example to play with in Python... You are in a TV show and three doors in front of you. Behind one of them is a car which you win if you choose the right door. The other two have only goats behind them. You select a door, the game master opens one of the goat doors and asks you "Do you want to want to choose another door or stay with your decision"?
